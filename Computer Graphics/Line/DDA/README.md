**Introduction :**

DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) is a line drawing algorithm used in computer graphics to generate a line segment between two specified endpoints. It is a simple and efficient algorithm that works by using the incremental difference between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the two endpoints to plot the line.

The steps involved in DDA line generation algorithm are:

1.  Input the two endpoints of the line segment, (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).
2.  Calculate the difference between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the endpoints as dx and dy respectively.
3.  Calculate the slope of the line as m = dy/dx.
4.  Set the initial point of the line as (x1,y1).
5.  Loop through the x-coordinates of the line, incrementing by one each time, and calculate the corresponding y-coordinate using the equation y = y1 + m(x ‚Äì x1).
6.  Plot the pixel at the calculated (x,y) coordinate.
7.  Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the endpoint (x2,y2) is reached.

DDA algorithm is relatively easy to implement and is computationally efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications. However, it has some limitations, such as the inability to handle vertical lines and the need for floating-point arithmetic, which can be slow on some systems. Nonetheless, it remains a popular choice for generating lines in computer graphics.
In any 2-Dimensional plane, if we connect two points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1), we get a line segment. But in the case of computer graphics, we can not directly join any two coordinate points, for that, we should calculate intermediate points‚Äô coordinates and put a pixel for each intermediate point, of the desired color with the help of functions like  [putpixel(x, y, K) in C](http://www.programmingsimplified.com/c/graphics.h/putpixel), where (x,y) is our co-ordinate and K denotes some color.

**Examples:**

> **Input:**  For line segment between (2, 2) and (6, 6) :  
> **Output:**  we need (3, 3) (4, 4) and (5, 5) as our intermediate points.
> 
> **Input:**  For line segment between (0, 2) and (0, 6) :  
> **Output:**  we need (0, 3) (0, 4) and (0, 5) as our intermediate points.

For using graphics functions, our system output screen is treated as a coordinate system where the coordinate of the top-left corner is (0, 0) and as we move down our y-ordinate increases, and as we move right our x-ordinate increases for any point (x, y). Now, for generating any line segment we need intermediate points and for calculating them we can use a basic algorithm called  [DDA(Digital differential analyzer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_differential_analyzer_%28graphics_algorithm%29)  line generating algorithm.
## **DDA Algorithm:**

Consider one point of the line as (X0, Y0) and the second point of the line as (X1, Y1).

> // calculate dx , dy
> 
> dx = X1 ‚Äì X0;  
> dy = Y1 ‚Äì Y0;
> 
> // Depending upon absolute value of dx & dy  
> // choose number of steps to put pixel as
> 
> // steps = abs(dx) > abs(dy) ? abs(dx) : abs(dy)  
> steps = abs(dx) > abs(dy) ? abs(dx) : abs(dy);
> 
> // calculate increment in x & y for each steps
> 
> Xinc = dx / (float) steps;  
> Yinc = dy / (float) steps;
> 
> // Put pixel for each step
> 
> X = X0;  
> Y = Y0;
> 
> for (int i = 0; i <= steps; i++)  
> {  
> putpixel (round(X),round(Y),WHITE);  
> X += Xinc;  
> Y += Yinc;  
> }

# DDA Function for line generation


def DDA(x0, y0, x1, y1):

	# find absolute differences
	dx = abs(x0 - x1)
	dy = abs(y0 - y1)

	# find maximum difference
	steps = max(dx, dy)

	# calculate the increment in x and y
	xinc = dx/steps
	yinc = dy/steps

	# start with 1st point
	x = float(x0)
	y = float(y0)

	# make a list for coordinates
	x_coorinates = []
	y_coorinates = []

	for i in range(steps):
		# append the x,y coordinates in respective list
		x_coorinates.append(x)
		y_coorinates.append(y)

		# increment the values
		x = x + xinc
		y = y + yinc

	# plot the line with coordinates list
	plt.plot(x_coorinates, y_coorinates, marker="o",
			markersize=1, markerfacecolor="green")
	plt.show()

## **Advantages of DDA Algorithm:**

-   It is a simple and easy-to-implement algorithm.
-   It avoids using multiple operations which have high time complexities.
-   It is faster than the direct use of the line equation because it does not use any floating point multiplication and it calculates points on the line.

## **Disadvantages of DDA Algorithm:**

-   It deals with the rounding off operation and floating point arithmetic so it has high time complexity.
-   As it is orientation-dependent, so it has poor endpoint accuracy.
-   Due to the limited precision in the floating point representation, it produces a cumulative error.

**Uses of DDA Algorithm:**

DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm is commonly used in computer graphics for line drawing. It has a wide range of applications, including:

1.  Creating basic graphics primitives: DDA algorithm can be used to draw simple shapes such as lines, polygons, and rectangles. By using a series of line segments generated using DDA, more complex shapes can also be created.
2.  Computer-aided design (CAD): In CAD software, DDA algorithm is used to draw lines between two points, which are used to create 2D and 3D models.
3.  Image processing: DDA algorithm can be used in image processing for tasks such as edge detection and image segmentation.
4.  Video game development: DDA algorithm is used for rendering lines and polygons in real-time graphics rendering for video games.
5.  Simulation and modeling: DDA algorithm is used to simulate physical phenomena such as ray tracing, which is used in computer graphics to create realistic images of 3D objects.  
    

**Issues in DDA Algorithm:**

some limitations and issues, which are:

1.  **Floating point arithmetic:**  The DDA algorithm requires floating-point arithmetic, which can be slow on some systems. This can be a problem when dealing with large datasets.
2.  **Limited precision:**  The use of floating-point arithmetic can lead to limited precision in some cases, especially when the slope of the line is very steep or shallow.
3.  **Round-off errors:** Round-off errors can occur during calculations, which can lead to inaccuracies in the generated line. This is particularly true when the slope of the line is close to 1.
4.  **Inability to handle vertical lines:**  The DDA algorithm is unable to handle vertical lines, as the slope becomes undefined.
5.  **Slow for complex curves:**  The DDA algorithm is not suitable for generating complex curves such as circles and ellipses, as it requires a large number of line segments to approximate these curves accurately.
6.  **Aliasing:** Aliasing occurs when the line segments generated using the DDA algorithm do not accurately represent the line being drawn, resulting in a jagged appearance.
7.  **Not suitable for thick lines:** The DDA algorithm generates thin lines, which can be problematic when drawing thick lines, as the line segments may overlap or leave gaps.
