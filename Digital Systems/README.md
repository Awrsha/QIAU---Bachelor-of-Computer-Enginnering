## Projects

1. **ALSU**: This project represents an ALSU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit), which combines arithmetic and logical operations into a single unit.

1. **Arithmetic_Unit_8bite**: This project implements an 8-bit arithmetic unit, capable of performing various arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

1. **Fulladder_8bit**: This project implements an 8-bit full adder, which adds two 8-bit binary numbers together along with a carry input.

1. **Logic_unit_8bite**: This project represents an 8-bit logic unit, which performs logical operations such as AND, OR, XOR, and NOT on two 8-bit binary numbers.

1. **Mux4to1_8bite**: This project implements an 8-bit 4-to-1 multiplexer, which selects one of four 8-bit input signals based on a select signal.

1. **Shift_Left_unit_8bit**: This project represents an 8-bit shift left unit, which performs a left shift operation on an 8-bit binary number.

1. **Shift_right_unit_8bit**: This project represents an 8-bit shift right unit, which performs a right shift operation on an 8-bit binary number.

1. **Simple_circuit**: This project represents a simple digital logic circuit, demonstrating basic logic gate connections and functionality.

1. **CRC_16_serial.v**: This project implements a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) encoder using a serial implementation.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Awrsha/Digital-Systems.git
   ```

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Digital-Systems-master
   ```

1. Open the project folder corresponding to the desired project.

1. Open the Verilog code file (with a `.v` extension) in a Verilog-compatible IDE or simulator.

1. Customize and modify the code as needed.

1. Compile and simulate the code using the Verilog simulator.

1. Verify the functionality of the digital logic circuit.

Feel free to explore and experiment with different projects to deepen your understanding of digital logic design.
