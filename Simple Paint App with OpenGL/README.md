# Paint Project using OpenGL and FreeGLUT

Welcome to the Paint Project! This simple drawing application utilizes OpenGL and FreeGLUT to offer an interactive canvas for creating various shapes, exploring colors, adjusting line thickness, and managing your drawings effortlessly.

## Features

### Drawing Tools
Explore a range of drawing tools including lines, rectangles, circles, triangles, squares, and ellipses, each accessible through intuitive keyboard shortcuts.

### Color Selection
Easily switch between different colors for your shapes and lines using convenient keyboard shortcuts.

### Line Thickness Control
Adjust the thickness of lines to emphasize details or create bold strokes, simply by using the designated keyboard shortcuts.

### Fill Option
Toggle the fill mode to fill shapes with color or leave them as outlines, offering versatile drawing possibilities.

### Save/Load Functionality
Save your creations to a file for later use and reload previous drawings whenever you want, maintaining your artistic progress effortlessly.

### Undo Function
Feel free to experiment! Undo your last action with a simple keyboard shortcut, allowing for a worry-free drawing experience.

## How to Use

- **Drawing Shapes**: Select a shape using keyboard shortcuts (1-6) and click/drag on the canvas to draw.
- **Color Selection**: Change colors instantly by pressing keys (x, r, g, b) for black, red, green, and blue respectively.
- **Background Color**: Alter the canvas background using keys (q, w, e, z) for different colors.
- **Line Thickness**: Increase (+) or decrease (-) line thickness using keyboard shortcuts.
- **Fill Toggle**: Switch between shape fill and outline mode by pressing 'f'.
- **Undo**: Press 'u' to undo the last action.
- **Save/Load**: Save shapes to a file using 's' and load shapes from a file with 'l'.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have OpenGL and FreeGLUT installed.
2. Compile the code using a C/C++ compiler that supports the necessary OpenGL and FreeGLUT libraries.
