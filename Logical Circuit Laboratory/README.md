## Projects

1. **AU.v**: This project represents an AU (Arithmetic Unit) component, which performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

1. **Basic-Full-Adder.v**: This project implements a basic full adder, which is a digital circuit that adds two binary numbers together along with a carry input.

1. **Basic-Half-Adder.v**: This project implements a basic half adder, which is a digital circuit that adds two binary numbers together without considering the carry input.

1. **Buffer.v**: This project represents a buffer, which is a digital circuit that amplifies the input signal without changing its logic level.

1. **Full-Adder-1bit with 2 half adder.v**: This project implements a 1-bit full adder using two half adders.

1. **Full-Adder-2bit.v**: This project implements a 2-bit full adder, which adds two 2-bit binary numbers together along with a carry input.

1. **Full-Adder1bit-with testbench.txt**: This project provides a testbench for the 1-bit full adder, allowing for simulation and verification of its functionality.

1. **LU-4bit.v**: This project represents a 4-bit LU (Logical Unit), which performs logical operations such as AND, OR, XOR, and NOT on 4-bit binary numbers.

1. **Multiplexer-2to1.v**: This project implements a 2-to-1 multiplexer, which selects one of two input signals based on a select signal.

1. **Multiplexer-4to1-8bit.v**: This project implements an 8-bit 4-to-1 multiplexer, which selects one of four 8-bit input signals based on a select signal.

1. **Multiplexer-4to1.v**: This project implements a 4-to-1 multiplexer, which selects one of four input signals based on a select signal.

1. **encoder4to2.v**: This project represents a 4-to-2 encoder, which encodes one of four input signals into a binary code.

1. **shift.v**: This project implements a shift register, which sequentially shifts the bits of a binary number.

1. **shift_right_Logical_8bit.v**: This project represents an 8-bit logical right shift circuit, which performs a logical shift operation on an 8-bit binary number.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Awrsha/Logical-Circuit-Laboratory.git
   ```

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Logical-Circuit-Laboratory-master
   ```

1. Open the project folder corresponding to the desired project.

1. Open the Verilog code file (with a `.v` extension) in a Verilog-compatible IDE or simulator.

1. Customize and modify the code as needed.

1. Compile and simulate the code using the Verilog simulator.

1. Verify the functionality of the digital logic circuit.

Feel free to explore and experiment with different projects to deepen your understanding of digital logic design.
